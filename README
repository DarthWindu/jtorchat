Philosophy:

Accessible to All. Alive and connected to All. Transparent to All.
How we keep to these philosophy

Accessible to All =                
	Writing it in java allows for easy 
	portability of code between platforms, 
	perhaps even in android phones.

Alive and connected to All = 
	Broadcast feature, and eventually group chat, 
	will provide talkers the ability 
	to interact as a group, or as a public mass.

Transparent to All =              
	All jtorchat will come with the source, 
	thus increasing transparency and thus security.
